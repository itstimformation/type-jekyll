    <h2 class="title">Bodoni</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Giambattista Bodoni (1740 – 1813) was an Italian typographer, type designer,
      compositor, printer and publisher in Parma. He first took the type designs
      of <b>Pierre Simon Fournier</b> as his exemplars, but afterwards became an
      admirer of the more modelled types of <b>John Baskerville</b>; and he and
      <b>Firmin Didot</b> evolved a style of type called 'New Face', in which the
      letters are cut in such a way as to produce a strong contrast between
      the thick and thin parts of their body.

      Bodoni designed many typefaces, each one in a large range of sizes.
      He is even more admired as a compositor, as the large range of sizes which
      he cut enabled him to compose his pages with the greatest possible
      subtlety of spacing. Like Baskerville, he set off his texts with wide
      margins and used little or no decoration.

    <h2 class="title">Inspiration</h2>
    <p class="content">
      Bodoni admired the work of John Baskerville and studied in detail the
      designs of French type founders Pierre Simon Fournier and Firmin Didot.
      Although he drew inspiration from the work of these designers, above all
      from Didot, no doubt Bodoni found his own style for his typefaces, which
      deservedly gained worldwide acceptance among printers.
      <br>
      <br>
      Although to a modern audience Bodoni is best known as the name of a
      typeface, Bodoni was an expert printer who ran a prestigious printing-office
      under the patronage of the Duke of Parma, and the design of his type was
      permitted by and showcased the quality of his company's work in metal-casting,
      printing and of the paper made in Parma. The hairline serifs and fine
      strokes reflected a high quality of casting, since on poor-quality printing
      equipment serifs had to be large to avoid wear snapping them. The smooth
      finish of his paper allowed fine detail to be retained on the surface.
      Bodoni also took care in the composition of his printing, using hierarchy
      and borders to create an appearance of elegance, and his range of type
      sizes allowed him flexibility of composition.
      <br>
      <br>
      The effective use of Bodoni in modern printing poses challenges common to
      all Didone designs. While it can look very elegant due to the regular,
      rational design and fine strokes, a known effect on readers is 'dazzle',
      where the thick verticals draw the reader's attention and cause them to
      struggle to concentrate on the other, much thinner strokes that define
      which letter is which. For this reason, using the right optical
      size of font has been described as particularly essential to achieve
      professional results. Fonts to be used at text sizes will be sturdier
      designs with thicker 'thin' strokes and serifs (less stroke contrast) and
      more space between letters than on display designs, to increase legibility.
      Optical sizes were a natural requirement of printing technology at the
      time of Bodoni, who had to cut each size of type separately, but declined
      as the pantograph, phototypesetting and digital fonts made printing the
      same font at any size simpler; a revival has taken place in recent years
      as automated font development has become possible. French designer
      Loïc Sander has suggested that the dazzle effect, common to all Didone
      designs, may be particularly common in designs produced in countries where
      designers are unfamiliar with how to use them effectively and where the
      fonts that are easily commercially available will tend to have been
      designed for headings. Modern Bodoni revivals intended for professional
      use such as Parmagiano and ITC Bodoni have a range of optical sizes,
      but this is less common on default computer fonts.

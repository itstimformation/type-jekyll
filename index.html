    <p class="intro">
      Type is everywhere – street signs, magazines, the web. Every typeface
      you see around you has been painstakingly and carefully planned out,
      and each has its own personality and vibe. But have you ever stopped
      to wonder how the typefaces we encounter everyday came to be? Who
      invented them, and why? If you’re interested in learning more about
      typography, you’ve come to the right place.
      <br>
      <br>
      What’s the difference between a typeface and a font? Before you jump
      in, let’s clarify the terminology used. Typography is the art of creating
      the letters we use everyday. It’s designing them and creating them and
      making them real. A font is a collection or set of letters – they’re the
      mechanism you use to get your message across to your reader. Every letter
      and dash and semi colon would be considered part of a specific font. A
      typeface is the design you see – the style and look of a specific font.
      <br>
      <br>
      Throughout history, typefaces have been influenced by technological
      advances, culture shifts, and just general boredom with the state of
      typography.

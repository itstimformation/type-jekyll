    <h2 class="title">Baskerville</h2>
    <p class="content">
      John Baskerville (1706 – 1775) was an English businessman whose
      entrepreneurial attentions included <i>japanning</i> and <i>papier-mâché</i>; he is,
      however, best remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for
      the design of the eponymous typeface which, to this very day, bears his name.

      Baskerville was born in the village of Wolverley, near Kidderminster in
      Worcestershire, and worked as a printer in Birmingham. Baskerville printed
      works for the University of Cambridge and, although an atheist, printed
      a splendid folio bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by
      <b>Benjamin Franklin</b>, a printer and fellow member of the Royal Society of
      Arts, who took the designs back to the newly created United States,
      where they were adopted for most federal government publishing.

    <h2 class="title">Influence in Britain and beyond</h2>
    <p class="content">
      While it found little success during the lifetime of John Baskerville,
      the typeface made a huge influence in Europe after the printer’s widow
      sold the Baskerville punches and matrixes to France, where it circulated
      among foundries.
      <br>
      <br>
      Isaac Moore from Bristol’s Fry Foundry created its own Baskerville in
      1766, along with Bell and Scotch Roman which all reflected the sharpness
      of the Baskerville roman. Admiration for the English typeface in France
      and Italy spread, and Baskerville’s high contrast letterforms evolved into
      an emergence of modern faces such as Didot and Bodoni.
      <br>
      <br>
      American typographer, Bruce Rogers, discovered a Baskerville type specimen
      in a Cambridge bookstore in 1917, and once he became printing adviser to
      Harvard University Press, he recommended that the type be casted from the
      original Baskerville matrixes, causing a revival to the typeface in the
      20th century.
      <br>
      <br>
      In 1996, Zuzana Licko designed a contemporary Baskerville revival, Mrs.
      Eaves, which was named after the printer’s mistress. To recreate the same
      open and light feeling that Baskerville had, Licko used a small x-height
      in relation to the cap-height and high contrast within the strokes.
      Baskerville was popular for its calligraphy influence and swashes, and
      Licko incorporated a lot of ligatures into Mrs. Eaves to mimic this style.
      In an interview in 2002, Licko expressed that the revival of classical
      typefaces such as Baskerville required scrutiny that later influenced her
      ideas for letterforms in fonts such as Tarzana and Solex.
      <br>
      <br>
      Baskerville is an elegant book face, and as proven by John Baskerville’s
      own treatment, it can excel in purely typographic compositions. Today it
      remains one of the most popular and classic typefaces for print, for its
      legibility and refined beauty.
